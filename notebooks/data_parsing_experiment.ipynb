however , the company\\'s results of operations can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates . the company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments . because the company\\'s markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes , there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components . the company\\'s operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the company\\'s ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments and to respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns . gross margin declined to 23% ( 23 % ) of net sales in 2001 from 27% ( 27 % ) in 2000 . this decline resulted primarily from gross margin of negative 2% ( 2 % ) experienced during the first quarter of 2001 compared to 26% ( 26 % ) gross margin for the same quarter in 2000 . in addition to lower than normal net .',\n",
